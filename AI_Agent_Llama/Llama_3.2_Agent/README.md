In this Repo, we explore the power of AI agents and large language models (LLMs) with function calling capabilities in a Python project, showcasing how generative AI can enhance various applications. We dive into fine-tuning open-source models, including LLaMA 3.2, on an Arabic dataset to better align them with specific tasks and objectives, unlocking their full potential for multilingual support.
